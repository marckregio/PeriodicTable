			"Under standard conditions it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. " +
			"Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. " +
			"For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. " +
			"When cut open, lithium exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, " +
			"then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, only appears in compounds, " +
			"which are usually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion, " +
			"is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, " +
			"lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.";
