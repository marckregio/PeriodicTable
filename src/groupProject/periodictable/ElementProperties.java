			"symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of 1.00794 u, " +
			"hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. " +
			"Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, " +
			"constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. " +
			"Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. " +
			"The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, symbol 1H), " +
			"has a single proton and zero neutrons.";

			"silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements. " +
			"Under standard conditions it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. " +
			"Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. " +
			"For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. " +
			"When cut open, lithium exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, " +
			"then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, only appears in compounds, " +
			"which are usually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion, " +
			"is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, " +
			"lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.";
	String Sodium = "Sodium";
	String Sodium_Desc = "is a chemical element with symbol Na (from Latin: natrium) and atomic number 11. " +
			"It is a soft, silver-white, highly reactive metal and is a member of the alkali metals; " +
			"its only stable isotope is 23Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, " +
			"but instead must be prepared from its compounds; " +
			"it was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. " +
			"Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, " +
			"and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). " +
			"Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble, " +
			"and their sodium has been leached by the action of water so that sodium and chlorine (Cl) " +
			"are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the Earth's bodies of oceanic water.";
	String Potassium = "Potassium";
	String Potassium_Desc = "is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin kalium) and atomic number 19. " +
			"Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and is very reactive with water, " +
			"generating sufficient heat to ignite the hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac flame. Naturally occurring " +
			"potassium is composed of three isotopes, one of which, 40K, is radioactive. Traces (0.012%) of this isotope are found in all " +
			"potassium making it the most common radioactive element in the human body and in many biological materials, " +
			"as well as in common building substances such as concrete";
